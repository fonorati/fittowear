Ciao! I am Francesco Onorati, science and technology enthusiast, mostly if applied for healthcare and medical purposes.
My educational and academic background is entirely in Bioengineering (BSc, MSc and PhD), and in my work experience in the industry I\'ve been a (Data) Scientist on wearable medical devices (WMDs). I\'ve designed and developed algorithms that use wearable sensor data to understand, characterize, explore physiological and behavioral states, or to identify and possibly alert users and caregivers for critical events.

As I tried to explain [in my first post]({% post_url 2021-02-17-first-post %}), I\'m trying to explore, and help others to, the intricacies of the WMDs' world, a world at the intersection of hardware, software, data science, medicine, clinical research and regulatory.
Therefore, competences required to work and succeed in this field are truly multi-disciplinary: electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, software engineering, bioengineering, and more specifically regarding algorithm development, a deep knowledge in programming, digital signal processing, machine learning or statistical learning, physiology (and more specific medical knowledge depending on the application), study design, statistical analysis, etc...

I\'ll certainly enjoy to read and talk about MWD, and I really hope I can offer my perspective on the topic and hopefully contribute to clarify some critical aspects.
