Ciao! I am Francesco Onorati, science and technology enthusiast, mostly if applied for healthcare and medical purposes.
My educational and academic background is entirely in Bioengineering (BSc, MSc and PhD), and in my work experience I\'ve been a (Data) Scientist working on applications for wearable medical devices (WMDs) industry. Specifically, I\'ve designed and developed algorithms that use wearable sensor data to understand, characterize, explore physiological and behavioral states, or to identify and possibly alert users and caregivers for critical events.

As I tried to explain [in my first post]({% link _posts/2021-02-17-first-post.md %}), I\'m trying to explore, and help others to, the intricacies of the WMDs' world, a world at the intersection of hardware, software, data science, clinical and medical research, and regulatory.
Therefore, competences required to develop a product or a service in this field are inherently multi-disciplinary: electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, bioengineering, medicine, and more specifically regarding algorithm development, you need knowledge in programming, digital signal processing, machine learning, physiology and/or psychology, clinical study designing, statistical analysis, etc...

I certainly enjoy to talk about MWD, and I really hope I can offer my perspective on the topic and hopefully contribute to clarify some critical aspects.
